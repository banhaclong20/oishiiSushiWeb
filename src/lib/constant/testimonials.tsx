      "This is one of our favorite sushi places in Dallas! Service is a bit slow but the food is always delicious! My boyfriend always gets the 45, the dumplings and a few other riceless rolls and they are consistently great. I was feeling sick the last time we went so I ordered the Pho....at a sushi place. To my surprise it was really really good! I will 100% order that again and if you're there on a cold day I highly recommend that you try it üß°",

      "Literally, the ‚ÄúFlower Roll‚Äù is THE BEST SUSHI I‚Äôve ever had in my entire life. Hands down. Take your time when you go, it‚Äôs worth the wait. There‚Äôs a reason this place is always packed - it‚Äôs that good. Never thought I‚Äôd like riceless rolls and now I‚Äôm hooked. They‚Äôve certainly earned and deserve the awards they‚Äôve received.",

      "I personally truly enjoyed my visit to Oishii.  The waiter offered us some appetizers that weren‚Äôt on the menu and it was so delicious.  The sushi was amazing and many of the dishes came *riceless* (which I was initially nervous about) but was pleasantly surprised.  I would definitely bring a jacket though because it was freezing in there! Probably to keep the fish fresh but it is worth mentioning.  I will definitely be back.",

      "I cannot say good enough things about this place.  My boyfriend and I visited Oishii atleast once a week for almost 6 months when I lived in dallas. I recently moved to a new city and I‚Äôm on a mission to find a place that I love just as much - but it is hard! I fell in love with Oishi and even created a note in my cell phone of all the dishes I tried and my rating, so I knew what to order and recommend to friends.  The presentation is outstanding, the freshness is always consistently amazing, and the service is great.  Be sure to be prepared for a crowd, the restaurant is always PACKED! But the service is always great despite them being slammed. I highly recommend this place! Here‚Äôs some pics of my favorites!",

The waiters are very knowledgeable and willing to make recommendations for you. They definitely get busy, so you definitely want to make a reservation! Service is great. Brendan is the best!",

      "My first time in and I am in love! My friend and ai ordered the M&M Roll (in photo), the Royce Roll, and the Caesar Roll. They were all delicious with very specific flavor profiles. The latter two were riceless and really exploded with flavor. You can tell by the texture and taste that the quality of fish used in their rolls and sushi is on the higher end. Will definitely be back to taste other rolls as this may just be my favorite sushi spot in town.",

      "The food here is amazing!!!! You get an explosion of flavor with every bite and I think his name was Cesar but the guy in the center making the sushi was the best. Our waiter wasn't that great and actually made us feel bad for ordering directly from the guys making the rolls but they saw us waiting and asked us what we would like. I still didn't want that to take away from the restaurant so will keep the 5 star rating. Will definitely return and sit at the sushi bar again to get service from Cesar",
